# Web Developer Interview Assessment.

Use TypeScript, C#, Java, or any other object oriented programming language of your choice to
complete the following tasks.

A. Build Queuing classes

a. Write 2 classes to implement the following IQueuable interface
Interface IQueuable {
//adds value to queue and returns new queue
enqueue(value: string): string[];
//removes item from queue, and returns the item removed
dequeue(): string;
//returns a list of all the items in the queue
getQueue(): string[];
//returns the number of items in the queue
size():number;
}

Build your queues ontop of arrays; call your classes FIFOQUEUE and
LIFOQUEUE (first-in first-out & last-in first-out) queues, or QUEUE and
STACK, whichever names you prefer.

b. If youâ€™ve written your enqueue and dequeue using array methods, how would you
rewrite the same functions without using any array methods?

I will rewrite the enqueue and dequeue using linked list method.

c. Show how you would improve the design of your classes, apply various design
patterns and techniques as you see fit
